When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    one can update the file on a remote repository from any computer. Also with remote repositories, collabrations are possible.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    since repositories are public, it is better to check before pulling all the changes down to your local machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are making a copy of a repository on your own while giving credit to the author. It won't affect the original after forking.

	Clones are copying the repository from github on your local machine and changes won't affect the online version unless you "git push"

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
